# Mortgage Payoff Calculator



This calculator is my effort to build a mortgage calculator that has the features I find lacking in most others, as well as having a secondary benefit of getting more familiar with React, Material UI, and modern TypeScript charting libraries. Currently the charting library in use is mui-xcharts, but once more features are implemented, I may compare alternative options.
## Roadmap

- Add Controls for basic mortgage parameters
- Allow user to refinance
- Allow user to make periodic and one-time extra payments
- Allow the user to compare investing extra money vs making extra payments
- Account for closing costs
- Allow the user to escrow taxes and insurance
- Allow for biweekly payment mortgages
- Add a colorblind mode
- Greater mobile friendliness
